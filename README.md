```bash
cd ds3_go_sdk
gb build all
```

* `DS3_ENDPOINT` - The URL to the DS3 Endpoint
* `DS3_ACCESS_KEY` - The DS3 access key
* `DS3_SECRET_KEY` - The DS3 secret key
* `http_proxy` - If set, the `Client` instance will proxy through this URL

Running Tests with GB
---------------------

There are unit tests in the `ds3` package, and integration tests in the `ds3_integration` package. To run tests, cd to
the Go SDK's main folder `ds3_go_sdk`.

In order to run the integration tests the following environment variables must be used to configure which DS3 appliance 
to run the tests against: `DS3_ENDPOINT`, `DS3_ACCESS_KEY`, and `DS3_SECRET_KEY`.

Run all tests (unit and integration) with test output:
```bash
gb test -v
```

Run unit tests with test output:
```bash
gb test -v ds3
```

Run integration tests with test output:
```bash
gb test -v ds3_integration
```
